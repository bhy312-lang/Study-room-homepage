# Project Blueprint

## Overview
This document outlines the structure, design, and features of the Study Room Homepage project.

## Detailed Outline of Implemented Styles, Design, and Features
- **Initial Setup**: The project is a framework-less web project with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.
- **Git Integration**: The project is connected to a GitHub repository: `https://github.com/bhy312-lang/Study-room-homepage.git`.
- **NPM Initialization**: A `package.json` file has been created.
- **Firebase Integration**: Confirmed that `.idx/mcp.json` contains the necessary Firebase server configuration.
- **Code Organization**: JavaScript functions have been moved from `index.html` to a separate `script.js` file for better maintainability.
